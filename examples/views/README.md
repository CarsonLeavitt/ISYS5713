# Exercising the API using a webpage

In this project there is a sample HTML file which will access the API.  To use this file, you'll need to start the API and then open the file in a web browser.  The file is located at: examples/views/fastapi.html.

In reality, it doesn't matter which backend is being used, the HTML file would work with any of the backends.  But you'll need to start the API using the backend you want to use.  In your case, it's likely that you would be using only a single back-end so there is no need to worry about which backend is being used.
