# Group Assignment 6 - Using Another API

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to help students to see how decisions made in their work affect the usability of their API.  In other words, how easy is it to use your API?  We're going to do this by having you use another group's API.  You will need to use the API that another group has created and then create a front-end application that uses that API.  You will create a brief video showing how your front-end leverages the API.

## Deliverable
Submit the GitHub URL of your repository containing all code, dependencies, and a README with instructions for running the application. The application will be evaluated based on the effective use of the API, correctness, completeness (utilization of various API endpoints), and creativity.  *Your front-end only needs to call 3 endpoints from the supplied API.*

***<span style="color:red">NOTE:</span>This should be a new repository than the one you have been using up until now.  You can clone/fork the other team's repository locally so that you can run the API - but your front-end should be in a completely new repository with only your code.***

Also you will need to submit a short video showing your front-end leveraging the new API.  We just want to see it in action.  You can use a simple screen capture tool like [screentogif](https://www.screentogif.com/downloads), just use Zoom or Teams to create the video.  The video should be no more than 3-4 minutes long.


## Background
The goal here is simply to use the API.  There is no need for something fancy.  *Your front-end only needs to call 3 endpoints from the supplied API.*  Keep it simple and realize that it is okay to hardcode the URL or query parameters if this makes the most sense for your application.

It may be helpful to tell us what you had in mind with regard to the application.  Like what would you do if you had more time and what would be the overall goal of the project, assuming resources and knowledge of how to pull it off weren't an issue.

## Help and Hints
It may be helpful to start by exercising a few of the endpoints via [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).  This will help you to understand how the API works and what data it returns.  Once you have a good understanding of the API, you can start to build your front-end.
